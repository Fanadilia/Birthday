                <p>Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.
                    Time is the longest distance between two places. Time changes everything except something within us
                    which is always surprised by change.

                <p> Till your good is better and your better is best. You deserve the best, and the best never comes
                    easy.
                    The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt
                    with the heart.</p>

                    The best way to predict the future is to create it. Do your best and forget the rest. The best
                    preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today. Good, better, best. Never let it rest..</p>
