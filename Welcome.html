                            Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies. Where there is love, there is life.
                            The greatest happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved; loved for ourselves, or rather, loved in
                            spite of ourselves. Love is friendship that has caught fire. The best thing to hold onto in life is each other.

                            To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. Love is not about how much you say 'I love you',
                            but how much you can prove that it's true.
                            Love is a game that two can play and hope for a win. Love doesn't make the world go round. Love is what
                            makes the ride worthwhile as in support and assistance.

                            Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired.
            Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own. Love is a friendship set to music
            once you are in the melody you will dance to it.The art of love is largely the art of
            persistence.

                            Love is the voice under all silences, the hope which has no opposite in fear; the strength so strong mere
            force is feebleness: the truth more first than sun, more last than star.
            Love is the flower you've got to let grow but if you were a flower, I will grow in mine so we will be
            inseparable

                            Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.
                            Time is the longest distance between two places. Time changes everything except something
                            within us which isalways surprised by change.
